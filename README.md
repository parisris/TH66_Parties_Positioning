# Thailand Political Spectrum Map

This is a web application that displays a political spectrum map of Thailand. The map shows the positions of different political parties on two axes: the x-axis represents the spectrum between liberal and conservative, while the y-axis represents the spectrum between capitalism and socialism.

The web application also allows users to change the theme from dark mode to light mode by clicking on a toggle button.

# Usage

To use the web application, simply open the index.html file in your web browser.

You can drag the logos of the political parties to different positions on the map to reflect your own perception of their political ideology.

You can also change the theme from dark mode to light mode by clicking on the toggle button located in the bottom right corner of the page.

# Technical details

The web application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the D3.js library to create the political spectrum map, and the dragElement() function to make the logos of the political parties draggable.

The initParties() function is called on page load and whenever the window is resized. This function initializes the positions and sizes of the logos of the political parties based on the size of the screen.

The setTheme() function is called when the user clicks on the toggle button to change the theme from dark mode to light mode and vice versa.
